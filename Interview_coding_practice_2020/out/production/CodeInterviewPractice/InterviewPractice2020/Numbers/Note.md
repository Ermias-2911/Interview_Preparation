Find the maximum sum of a subsequence with no adjacent elements:
    - Given an integer array, find the maximum sum of subsequence where the subsequence contains no element at adjacent positions.
      Input:  { 1, 2, 9, 4, 5, 0, 4, 11, 6 }
      Output: The maximum sum is 26
      The maximum sum is formed by subsequence { 1, 9, 5, 11 }
